To use this app locally, clone this repo. Then install dependencies with `npm install` terminal command.

To start the server and open the page in your local browser, use the terminal command `npm run start`.

**NB in order to run this app, you will need an OpenWeatherMap API key. You can get one easily by signing up at openweathermap.org - it's completely free.

Once you have a key, create an .env file in the root directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key there. A model (without key) is included in .sample-env for easy reference. Simply add your key after the equals sign.

## About
I built this app to practice working with Web APIs and asynchronous code. The app uses OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather based on user's location, and dynamically updates UI based on the user's input.
